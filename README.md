## ðŸ“„ Repository

Welcome to **LeetCodeSolves** â€“ my personal public repository for sharing solutions to LeetCode problems using C++.

Inside the `Solutions` folder, you'll find:
* Folder with the codes Iâ€™ve written for each problem
* Documentation explaining each solution and complexity analysis (both time and space)

I'm a Computer Engineering student currently learning C++, git and problem-solving for job interviews, so please note that some solutions may not be the best ones.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Approach

I aim to create the **most elegant and simple** solutions possible with the **smallest complexities**.

I prioritize the following, in order:

1. **Time Complexity**
2. **Space Complexity**
3. **Simplicity & Elegance**

## ðŸ§© Solution Structure
My LeetCode solutions have the following basic structure:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    outputType solutionFunction(inputType input) {
        // Solution goes here
    }
};
```
